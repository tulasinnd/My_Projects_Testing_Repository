# Here are some breakfast ideas you can make using the ingredients you listed:

# Veggie omelet: Beat the eggs in a bowl and add chopped onions, chillies, cabbage, peas, and sweetcorn. Heat a non-stick pan, pour in the egg mixture, and cook until the eggs are set. Fold the omelet and serve with a side of sliced tomatoes.

# Roasted vegetable hash: Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Cut the sweet potato, potato, carrot, beetroot, and onion into small cubes, and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve with poached eggs on top.

# Spicy sweet potato toast: Cut the sweet potato into 1/2-inch thick slices and toast in a toaster or oven until tender. Mash some avocado and spread it on the sweet potato slices. Top with cooked beans, chopped chillies, and a squeeze of lemon.

# Tomato and coconut chutney sandwich: Make a quick chutney by blending chopped tomatoes, coconut, chillies, lemon juice, and honey in a food processor. Toast some bread and spread the chutney on one slice. Top with sliced boiled eggs and cabbage, and another slice of bread.

# Vegetable frittata: Beat the eggs in a bowl and add chopped onions, peas, sweetcorn, and grated carrot. Heat a non-stick pan, pour in the egg mixture, and cook until the eggs are set. Top with grated cheese and place under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve with a side of sliced tomatoes.
